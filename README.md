# Welcome to EmotionKnow!

EmotionKnow was created with React.js front end, Ruby on Rails API, full Authentication with bcrypt and json web tokens, Redux for state management, Semantic UI React and Custom CSS for styling, Microsoft Azure for blob storage, Twinword Emotion Analysis API, and MorphCast SDK based on Deep Neural Network Artificial Intelligence.

EmotionKnow was inspired by my 11-year-old daughter, from the desire to stay connected to her mental health and support her in building emotional intelligence. I had the ambition to integrate my education in Positive Psychology with Computer Science and built an app to support adolescents and their families during pivotal stages of development.

EmotionKnow offers children new ways to express themselves through journaling with video and audio recording, or writing electronically.
